Possible strategies
===========================

## Scout defence
Use the scout's large bullet sight and fast movement to quickly shield trees from bullets

## Tree grid
Farm grid like so:

- TREE GARDENER TREE TREE GARDENER TREE TREE GARDENER TREE TREE GARDENER TREE etc.
- TREE GARDENER TREE TREE GARDENER TREE TREE GARDENER TREE TREE GARDENER TREE etc.
- TREE GARDENER TREE TREE GARDENER TREE TREE GARDENER TREE TREE GARDENER TREE etc.
- etc.
    
 Where each gardener is stationary and is in charge of two trees to water.
 Gardeners on the edges also build robots when necessary.
    
 EDIT: It would be much more effective if each gardener has 10 trees to attend to.

## Tree ring
Farm grid is gardeners spaced apart, surrounding themselves with up to as many trees as their watering radius allows, or 10, whichever is lower.

## Sentries
- Send scouts out to find the locations of enemy archons
- Scouts relay the position to the defences at the base
- Defenses start shooting pentads of bullets at the position of the archons, from multiple angles
